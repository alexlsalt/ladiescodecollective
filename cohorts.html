      There comes a point in your coding journey when it just doesn’t cut it to show your partner, sister, or roommate for the I’ve-lost-counth time if your site looks better with a certain div shifted 10 more pixels to the left or not.
      <br><br>
      Your family is over the keyboard clicks and the “Five more minutes - I just need to solve this bug” and you coming up for air two hours later, jovial for solving it but slightly guilty for missing out on that particular evening's sunset or call for dinner.
    </h3>

    <h2 class="half_highlight">
      But what if you gave yourself scheduled, quality time each week with your creative coding project?
    </h2>

    <h4>
      <span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span> Time that was carved out uniquely for you and your keyboard clicks.
      <br><br>
      <span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span> Time that allowed you to focus wholeheartedly on your project instead of feeling that slight twinge of guilt for not paying attention to your dog who keeps dropping his favorite toy at your feet.

      <li><span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span> Maybe you have a great idea for a new JavaScript project you’d be thrilled to add to your coding portfolio but each week passes by without you even starting the initial HTML file for.</li>
      <li><span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span> Maybe you’d like to finally take that course on accessible design, but as always, it keeps finding its way to the very bottom of the weekly to-do list (speaking of to-do list, shouldn’t you have coded one of those by now to have also added to your portfolio?)</li>
      <li><span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span> Maybe you’ve been telling yourself for months on end that you're finally going to build a Gatsby site, but again - other tasks always end up taking priority.</li>
      <li><span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span> Maybe you just want to sit yourself down to actually learn CSS Grid because you keep telling yourself it’s time already! </li>

      Whatever it is that continues to persistently knock at your mind’s door - treat yourself to the quality time you need to cultivate your coding & technical skills.
