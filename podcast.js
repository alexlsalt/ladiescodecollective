    description: "Today’s topic is all about the negative effects that perfectionism can have on us as developers on our coding journeys.<br><br>There's this pressure to perform in a way where we feel the need to make it seem as though whatever we’ve built or are working on is perfect and essentially 'fault-less.'<br><br>We feel like any new project we start or new skill we’re trying to build isn’t adequate or appropriate if it doesn’t “come out of the box” in its final, most perfect stage.<br><br>Listen in for more about how to recognize and address perfectionism along the coding journey!<br><br>Resources mentioned in this episode:<ul><li>Pure React by Dave Ceddia</li></ul>"

      description: "This episode takes a deep dive into why exactly we should resist giving up after only a few weeks of learning something.<br><br>I often see beginners in the coding community getting frustrated that learning to program isn't 'sticking' as quickly as they'd like it to.<br><br>But the problem with thinking that we should give up after a finite amount of time is that we don't even consider staying with something for the ultimate long run.<br><br>Think about taking a flight across the world. When you get on the airplane, you buckle up and prepare ourselves for a long flight. We don't have any other choice than to sit back and be patient. We need to have the same mindset when we're learning to program.<br><br>We discuss learning a true programming language like JavaScript and how we don't always realize that it's a completely different way of thinking.<br><br>Tune in to hear my three main tips for sticking with programming for the long haul until you find success with it (in whatever way that looks for you!)<br><br>"

      description: "When learning to code, there's no true one-size-fits-all blueprint for learning to code. We might feel like we have so, so many choices of what to do next that it can feel really stressful. We obviously want to be sure we’re not wasting time in learning something so we need to be *sure* that what we’re pursuing is worthwhile.<br><br>But even if we learn something that we don’t end up using, doesn’t it still give us a little bit more of an idea about the overall ecosystem of programming?<br><br>The secret is to put one foot in front of the other day after day after day.<br><br>Other mentions in this episode: <br><ul><li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=l1UEE9famfA&feature=emb_title&fbclid=IwAR2XhM8kkWScxb5d12s4u8v-1MZh1C8CRhBoqVopsfZyS8_LgHxbPWfsEKg' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>My interview on the Way of Living Podcast</a></li> </ul><br>"
